This simple Node.js module takes a string as a CLI input and converts it into a [mocking Spongebob meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mocking-spongebob) style text.

It follows one simple rules: no more than three consecutive same-case (uppercase/lowercase) characters.

## Installation

#### As a Node module
A simple `npm install spongemockify` inside your project folder should do the job.

#### As a CLI tool
From any folder, execute `npm install -g spongemockify` command. Superuser access may be needed in Unix/Linux systems.

## Usage
As a CLI tool:
```bash
spongemockify <string>
```

## Acknowledgement

Special thanks to [Shawon Ashraf](https://github.com/ShawonAshraf) who spent his precious time to kill some bugs and make the module usable as a CLI command.
